    <h3 id="media-type-choosing">Selection of Media Types for MathML Instances</h3>

    <p>MathML contains two distinct vocabularies. Presentation markup is
      for encoding visual presentation, and consists of the elements defined
      in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/chapter3.html">Chapter 3 of the MathML specification</a>.
      Content markup is for encoding mathematical meaning, and consists of the elements defined in
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/chapter4.html">Chapter 4 of the MathML specification</a>.
      In addition, both the presentation and content
      vocabularies contain the <code class="element">math</code>, <code class="element">semantics</code>,
      <code class="element">annotation</code> and <code class="element">annotation-xml</code> elements. The MathML
      media types should be used as follows:</p>

    <dl>

      <dt><code>application/mathml-presentation+xml</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>MathML instances that consist solely of presentation markup.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>application/mathml-content+xml</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>MathML instances that consist solely of content
          markup.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>application/mathml+xml</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Any valid MathML instance.  Must be used for MathML instances that are a
          mix of presentation and content markup, or where the composition of an
          instance is not known or cannot be guaranteed.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Some MathML applications may import and export only one of these
      two vocabularies, while others may produce and consume each in a
      different way, and still others may process both without any
      distinction between the two.  Internally, many MathML processors favor
      one vocabulary, and support the other vocabulary via conversion if at
      all.  For example, computational software typically favors content
      markup while typesetting software generally favors presentation
      markup. By using separate media types for MathML instances consisting
      solely of presentation or solely of content markup, such processors can
      conduct negotiation for MathML representations in the preferred
      vocabulary. For example, consider two web services offering mathematical
      computation services such as a spreadsheet and a computer algebra system.
      Internally both prefer content markup, but by
      default, both generate presentation markup for output.  In the
      absence of media type negotiation, a likely scenario for an exchange
      between two systems involves two conversions, content to
      presentation and back again.  With negotiation, the conversions are
      eliminated.  Similarly, a client with a MathML instance in one of the
      vocabularies might seek a web service that preferred that
      vocabulary.</p>

    <p>MathML is commonly used in compound document settings, e.g. within
      HTML, where content is drawn from a variety of sources, and processed
      with multiple tools.  In these cases, the composition of MathML
      expressions generally is not known or at least cannot be guaranteed
      by a user agent.  Consequently, the <code>application/mathml+xml</code> type
      should be used, as it may be applied to any valid MathML expression.
      Since most applications involve data from untrusted sources,
      <code>application/mathml+xml</code> will commonly be appropriate to use as a
      default type, and all MathML processors are encouraged to accept it as
      a fallback to the more specific formats.</p>

    <p>The media types described here may be applied to instances of
      all versions of MathML.  MathML instances
      do not contain version numbers, so processors and producers must follow the
      normative backward compatibility behavior.</p>

        <p>The encoding considerations of <code>application/xml</code> as specified in

      </dd>

      <dt>Security considerations</dt>
      <dd>

        <p>As with other XML types and as noted in [[RFC3023]] section 10,
          repeated expansion of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used
          to consume large amounts of memory, which may cause XML processors in
          constrained environments to fail.</p>

        <p>Several MathML elements may cause arbitrary URIs to be referenced. In
          this case, the security issues of [[RFC3986]], section 7, should be
          considered.</p>

        <p>In common with HTML, MathML documents may reference external media
          such as images, style sheets, and scripting languages. Scripting
          languages are executable content. In this case, the security
          considerations in the Media Type registrations for those formats shall
          apply. Similarly, MathML annotation elements may contain content intended for
          execution or processing. In the case where the processor recognizes
          and processes the additional content, or where further processing of
          that content is dispatched to other processors, additional security
          issues potentially arise. Since the normative semantics of the MathML
          specifications do not require processing of annotation elements, such
          issues fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>

        <p>MathML may be used to describe mathematical expressions intended
          for evaluation in computing systems.  Because of the nature of
          mathematics, a seemingly innocuous expression may lead to a
          computation which does not terminate or is impractically large.  This
          introduces the risk that computational processors in constrained
          environments may fail.</p>

        <p>In addition, because of the extensibility features for MathML and of
          XML in general, it is possible that <code>application/mathml+xml</code> may describe
          content that has security implications beyond those described
          here. However, if the processor follows only the normative semantics
          of the MathML specifications, this content will be outside the MathML namespace
          and shall be ignored.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Interoperability considerations</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The MathML specification describes processing semantics that dictate
          behavior that must be followed when dealing with, among other things,
          unrecognized elements and attributes, both in the MathML namespace and
          in other namespaces.</p>

        <p>Because MathML is extensible, conformant <code>application/mathml+xml</code> processors
          must expect that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be
          guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD or Schema or
          that the processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes
          in the document.</p>

        <p>MathML instances do not contain version numbers, so processors and producers must
          follow the normative backward compatibility behavior described in the MathML
          specifications.</p>

        <p>In computational contexts, the result of evaluating a MathML

      <dd>
        <p>The encoding considerations of <code>application/xml</code> as specified in

      </dd>

      <dt>Security considerations</dt>
      <dd>

        <p>As with other XML types and as noted in [[RFC3023]] section 10,
          repeated expansion of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used
          to consume large amounts of memory, which may cause XML processors in
          constrained environments to fail.</p>

        <p>Several MathML elements may cause arbitrary URIs to be referenced. In
          this case, the security issues of [[RFC3986]], section 7, should be
          considered.</p>

        <p>In common with HTML, MathML documents may reference external media
          such as images, style sheets, and scripting languages. Scripting
          languages are executable content. In this case, the security
          considerations in the Media Type registrations for those formats shall
          apply. Similarly, MathML annotation elements may contain content intended for
          execution or processing. In the case where the processor recognizes
          and processes the additional content, or where further processing of
          that content is dispatched to other processors, additional security
          issues potentially arise. Since the normative semantics of the MathML
          specifications do not require processing of annotation elements, such
          issues fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>

        <p>MathML may be used to describe mathematical expressions intended
          for evaluation in computing systems.  Because of the nature of
          mathematics, a seemingly innocuous expression may lead to a
          computation which does not terminate or is impractically large.  This
          introduces the risk that computational processors in constrained
          environments may fail.</p>

        <p>In addition, because of the extensibility features for MathML and of
          XML in general, it is possible that <code>application/mathml-content+xml</code> may describe
          content that has security implications beyond those described
          here. However, if the processor follows only the normative semantics
          of the MathML specifications, this content will be outside the MathML namespace
          and shall be ignored.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Interoperability considerations</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The MathML specification describes processing semantics that dictate
          behavior that must be followed when dealing with, among other things,
          unrecognized elements and attributes, both in the MathML namespace and
          in other namespaces.</p>

        <p>Because MathML is extensible, conformant <code>application/mathml-content+xml</code> processors
          must expect that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be
          guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD or Schema or
          that the processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes
          in the document.</p>

        <p>MathML instances do not contain version numbers, so processors and producers must
          follow the normative backward compatibility behavior described in the MathML
          specifications.</p>

        <p>In computational contexts, the result of evaluating a MathML
          expression is system-specific, and is not guaranteed to be
          interoperable between systems.</p>

        <p>This specification does not record a file extension for the media type
          <code>application/mathml-content+xml</code>> because we expect tools processing files
          with MathML inside to have sufficient information with the generic media-type
          (<code>application/mathml+xml</code>) while other content negotiation forms will take advantage
          of specific media-types.</p>
